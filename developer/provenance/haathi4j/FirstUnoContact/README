This is the Hello, World! program for UNO and was adapted from the OpenOffice Wiki
at https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/FirstSteps/First_Contact.
It can be built using the build.xml ant file, but, more usefully, Eclipse will
also compile the single source file on its own and then also run it and debug it
from a launch configuration.  The launch configuration is very carefully constructed
to do this and can serve as a template for other launches.  Note the dependency
on the Loader project and that unseen Loader files that are placed in the bin
directory, possibly by hand.
