Contained in this project are the jar files from the OpenOffice.  These originate
specifically from the program/classes directory of the OpenOffice binary distribution.
Having them here makes it possible to build these projects without having OpenOffice
installed, or having a different version installed.

These are required for compilation of other projects.  They should declare themselves
dependent upon this project and for the Java Build Path property, list Exe as a
required project on the build path.
