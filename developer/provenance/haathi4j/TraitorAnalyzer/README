This program is used to drive the correspondingly named C++ program, but it first
transforms out.wm into out.wmc.  In doing so it decides what should become of the
indeterminate bits from the watermark bit extraction.  There may well be different
strategies for dealing with these bits.  In addition, even if none is indeterminate,
the watermark bit extractor includes spaces and dashes in its output showing that
some characters are not watermarked at all or that some letters group into words, etc.
This program removes all that extra formatting so that only the bits remain and the
C++ version traitorTracer can do its work as efficiently as possible.
