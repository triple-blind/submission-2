This is a driver for the PrecisionAnalyzer above.  It can choose, by
means of commenting out the undesired one, between the Exact- and Approximate-
PrecisionAnalyzer.  It also runs the document creation and conversion to JPG that
precedes the analysis.  It controls the variables for the processes and can
be used to script the exploration of the variable space.  How does the precision
vary across JPG resolution or watermarking schemes, for example.
