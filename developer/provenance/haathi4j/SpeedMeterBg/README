This is a driver for the C++ autotype program, which can measure the
time it takes to load, type, and save Provenance documents with and without
watermarks.  It adds a WPM calculation and makes it easier to script autotype.

This all happens for a presently hard-coded user.  The save occurs to a local
file and not the network so that this can all work without running servers.
While the Haathi extension is not accessed directly, the extension configuration
is used to find the dictionary for the synonym watermarking.  The bootstrapping
of OpenOffice in C++ is already complex, and starting the C++ from Java makes
it even more so.  Take into account all the parameters in the code and also
in the launch configuration.
