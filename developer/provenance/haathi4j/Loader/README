In order to bootstrap a Java program that interacts with OpenOffice, a Loader
program must first be started which configures OpenOffice for use under such
conditions.  These files implement the Loader.  They were extracted from the
OpenOffice binary distribution using the build.xml file from the FirstUnoContact
project.  They were extracted from the jar files in program/classes using
the code

	<fileset id="bootstrap.glue.code" dir="${OO_SDK_HOME}/classes">
		<patternset>
			<include name="com/sun/star/lib/loader/*.class" />
		</patternset>
	</fileset>
	
Now that they are here, other projects can use them without requiring
OpenOffice to be installed.

These files need to get to the bin directory of projects, but OpenOffice
doesn't seem to have a way of doing that and it also likes to erase any
unrecognized files in that directory.  It seems to work best to reference
this project as a library.  In the Java Build Path properties, add a Library
containing a class folder for Loader/loader.  In addition, copy these
class files to the bin folder of the particular project.
