This project is used to evaluate the fidelity of the watermarking process.  It
compares the watermark bits that were embedded into a document with the watermark
bits that were extracted from it.

Given knowledge of the text that was used to create the document and the imperfect
text that was extracted, the analyzer aligns the corresponding sets of watermarks
so that the accuracy of watermark extraction can better be measured.  For example,
if during OCR a character is lost in the output, all the watermark bits will be
shifted and half the subsequent comparisons, on average, will show mismatches.
After alignment, only the deleted watermark should be in error.
