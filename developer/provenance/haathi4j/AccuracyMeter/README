Projects named meter are generally used to drive lower-lever programs.  The meters
are more or less scripts which are used to configure and group the other programs.
This one controls the WatermarkBitAnalyzer and all the programs it depends on.
For each of the meters there is also a *.vsd documentation diagram along with a
launch file.  Directory and environment settings are fairly specific to an
installation, so changes will be necessary.

This meter, at least temporarily, totals up the accuracies of the multiple
watermarking schemes which can be used on a document and computes an overall
accuracy.  It controls the parameters of the watermarking and conversion to JSP
so that the accuracy can be measured across various dimensions of the problem
space.
