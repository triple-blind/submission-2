This project tests the serialization of OpenOffice classes.  It is similar
to boostTest then except for the addition of the Haathi library dependency.
Because of this, it must have access to certain DLLs during runtime and
that should be configured in the project.  For Windows the DLLs are
automatically copied to the target directory.  For other operating
systems, the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
are changed so that the necessary *.so or *.dylib files can be found.
This is the strategy taken for all the programs dependent upon the
Haathi library.
