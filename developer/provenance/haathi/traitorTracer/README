The main program in this project, TraitorTracer.cpp, appears to be a work
in progress.  It's goal seems to be to track down who might have tampered
with the image in a document.  It's does not seem obvious how it goes
about it.  Because of the mystery, the original Makefile is included as
well as an image and these notes:

"First convert the PDF to an image as follows :

$ convert -density 400 -quality 400 wmk.pdf img.jpg

If the PDF contains more than one page, you will get more than one image like img-0,img-1 etc.

Then, run make to compile and use make run to run the traitor tracer."
