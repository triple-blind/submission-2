This just checks to see whether basic Boost functionality is present.
Note that the entire set of Boost files is not included with the source
distribution.  Included is only what seemed necessary for the serialization
portion which Haathi uses.  Linux and Macintosh may include preinstalled
Boost libraries to support their applications.  However, they will likely
not include the header files needed to compile new programs.  In either case,
it is possible that a different version is being used than what Haathi
expects.  This test uses functions included in both the header and library
portions of Boost and should use the version that is distributed with
Haathi rather than anything preinstalled.
