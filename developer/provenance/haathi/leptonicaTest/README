The test checks and outputs version numbers of leptonica and its
prerequisite libraries.  If the leptonica version number is unexpected,
it fails, and it might be a good idea to check what functionality has
changed in the update and in turn update this test.  Note again that
this test program will not be able to link statically to the Windows
C runtime library because of problems with leptonica.
