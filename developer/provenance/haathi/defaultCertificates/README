Haathi is able to communicate with various preconfigured but selectable
servers.  Each has a name, IP address, port, and certificate that needs to
be stored.  For expediency, I guess, these are stored in a readable binary
format courtesy of boost.  This project builds the configuration file so
that it can be included in the packaged extension.  It looks like there
were plans for users to add servers via the extension, but the part that
manages the certificates does not seem to be complete.  In any case, if
a change is desired in which servers are preconfigured, start here and
follow the trail to NetworkInfo.cpp where the values are hard-coded.
