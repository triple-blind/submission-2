/** is the UNO representation of the Automation type <code>DATE</code>.
    <p>
    A <code>DATE</code> could actually be representd as<atom>double</atom> in
    UNO and therefore a typedef from <atom>double</atom> to a date type would
    do. But a typedef cannot be expressed in all language bindings. In the
    case where no typedefs are supported the actual type is used. That is, a
    typedef'd date type would be represented as <code>double</code> in Java.
    The information that the <atom>double</atom> is a date type is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
    When calling Automation objects from UNO the distinction between
    <atom>double</atom> and date type is important. Therefore <type>Date</type>
    is declared as struct.
