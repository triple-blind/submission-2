/** Central service of the Accessibility API that gives access to various
    facets of an object's content.

    <p>This service has to be implemented by every class that represents the
    actual accessibility information of another UNO service.  It exposes two
    kinds of information: A tree structure in which all accessible objects
    are organized can be navigated in freely.  It typically represents
    spatial relationship of one object containing a set of children like a
    dialog box contains a set of buttons.  Additionally the
    <type>XAccessibleContext</type> interface of this service exposes
    methods that provide access to the actual object's content.  This can be
    the object's role, name, description, and so on.</p>
