    A "flat" detection means specifying the document format by using
    the URL and some configuration data only. That will perform but produce
    may invalid results if e.g., the extension of the document is wrong.
    A "deep" detection means looking into the document stream to be right
    which format it supports. Of course that includes a "flat" detection before.
    The combination of both ones should produce stable results everytime.

		<p>
        Instead of <member>XTypeDetection::queryTypeByURL()</member> this function
        use a <type>MediaDescriptor</type> to specify the document for detection.
        Such descriptor hold different informations about the document.
        He will be passed to any part of made detection process and every part
        can change it to actualize it.
        The property <member>MediaDescriptor::URL</member> should be set on
        this descriptor as minimum. It specifies the location of the document.
        If this parameter is missing another one is required: <member>MediaDescriptor::InputStream</member>.
        This can be usefull to prevent operaton against multiple opening of the stream
        and perform the operation. If this stream isn't already included the detection
        will open it (if allowed!) and add it to the descriptor so it will be available for
        all following parts.
        A combination of both parameters can be usefull to perform the operation
        and make results more stable; but only one of them is required.
        Of course its possible to specify more document properties (e.g.
        <member>MediaDescriptor::ReadOnly</member>).
        <br>
        As an additional feature it's possible to suppress "deep" detection by using argument
        <var>AllowDeep</var>.
		</p>

        @param Descriptor
            means the <type>MediaDescriptor</type> which specify the ressource for detection

        @param AllowDeep
