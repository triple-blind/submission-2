/** A view in the drawing framework is any object that paints into a pane.
    <p>Typical examples are the Impress views that show a graphical
    representation of a document.  But the task pane, which is primarily a
    container of dialogs, is a view as well.</p>
    <p>Luckily the drawing framework does not need to know much about what a
    view is.  It just needs to identify view objects and a typesafe way to
    reference them.</p>
    <p>The URL prefix of views is <code>private:resource/view</code></p>
