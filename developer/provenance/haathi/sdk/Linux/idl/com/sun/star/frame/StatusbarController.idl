/** is an abstract service for a component which offers a more complex user
    interface to users within a status bar.

    <p>
    A generic status bar function is represented as a text field which
    provides status information to the user. A status bar controller can be
    added to a status bar and provides information or functions with a more
    sophisticated user interface.<br/>
    A typical example for a status bar controller is the zoom level chooser
    within the statusbar. It provides an option to change the zoom level of
    an application.
