/** A simple base implementation for reference-counted objects.

    Classes that want to implement a reference-counting mechanism based on the
    acquire()/release() interface should derive from this class.

    The reason to have class local operators new and delete here is technical.
    Imagine a class D derived from SimpleReferenceObject, but implemented in
    another shared library that happens to use different global operators new
    and delete from those used in this shared library (which, sadly, seems to
    be possible with shared libraries).  Now, without the class local
    operators new and delete here, a code sequence like "new D" would use the
    global operator new as found in the other shared library, while the code
    sequence "delete this" in release() would use the global operator delete
    as found in this shared library---and these two operators would not be
    guaranteed to match.

    There are no overloaded operators new and delete for placement new here,
    because it is felt that the concept of placement new does not work well
    with the concept of reference-counted objects; so it seems best to simply
    leave those operators out.

    The same problem as with operators new and delete would also be there with
    operators new[] and delete[].  But since arrays of reference-counted
    objects are of no use, anyway, it seems best to simply declare and not
    define (private) operators new[] and delete[].
