		needs to be created. If not given, an empty Viewport is implied which
		means all is visible.

		double Time

		Defines the point in time for which the geometry is defined. This may
		lead to varied results for animated objects. This value is defined in the
		range [0.0 .. n[, negative values are not allowed. If not given, a value of
		0.0 is implied.
