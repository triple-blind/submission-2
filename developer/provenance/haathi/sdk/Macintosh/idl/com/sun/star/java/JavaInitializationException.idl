/** indicates that there is no Java available <p>
    It is presumed that Java is a vital part of an office installation.
    That is, if Java does work for some reason, it it not guaranteed that
    the office is functional. A JavaInitializationException is therefore
    caused by some misconfiguration of Java which is closer described by
    other exceptions in this namespace which inherit JavaInitializationException.
    These are:
    <p>
    <type scope:"com::sun::star::java">JavaDisabledException</type> <br>
    <type scope:"com::sun::star::java">JavaNotConfiguredException</type> <br>
    <type scope:"com::sun::star::java">MissingJavaRuntimeException</type> <br>
