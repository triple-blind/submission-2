/** implements a property handler for use with an <type scope="com::sun::star::inspection">ObjectInspector</type>
    which provides properties related to binding form control models to XForm bindings.

    <p>The handler introduces new properties to choose an <type scope="com::sun::star::xforms">XModel</type>
    and a <type scope="com::sun::star::xforms">Binding</type> within this model. Additionally,
    it introduces properties which reflect the different facets of the binding (e.g.
    <member scope="com::sun::star::xforms">Binding::BindingExpression</member>), so they can be changed
    directly in the <type scope="com::sun::star::inspection">ObjectInspector</type> as if they were a
    property of the form component which is being inspected.</p>

    <p>The handler expects a value named "ContextDocument" in the context in which it is created.
    That is, the <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">XComponentContext</type> used for creating the
    <type>CellBindingPropertyHandler</type> is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this
    value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the <type scope="com::sun::star::xforms">XFormsSupplier</type>
    interface), this document is used to do XML binding related work.</p>
