    the sentence end and report all errors found.</p>

    It might also check style, used terms etc. Basically it can check every 
    aspect of a single sentence. Since the text provided is always the complete
    paragraph it can also choose to analyze the context of the sentence currently
    required to be checked. However error reports need to be limited to the
    current sentence.</p>
