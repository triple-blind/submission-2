/** Factory interface to generate properties for all animated targets.<p>

    Depending on mode and content of a SMIL animation tree, animation
    targets can have global properties different from the target's
    default. The most prominent example for such a difference is shape
    visibility: when a shape is to become visible in the course of a
    SMIL animation, it naturally has to be initially invisible for
    that effect to have any visible impact.<p>

    This factory interface is able to generate sequences of global
    properties for all targets referenced in a given SMIL animation
    tree.
