This is a Monte Carlo simulation of the SomewhereEngine algorithm that writes
a watermark at a random position in the document in order to ensure that there
is at least one complete mark present.  How efficient is the algorithm.  With
a document size of 1024 characters and a watermark "size" of 32 characters,
32 complete watermarks can be inserted at the most.  How many on average will
be complete.  It looks like around half of them.  This is more than I expected
and I am pleased with the finding.
