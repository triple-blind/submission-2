Component Registration Data

This is where we indicate the files that define this component and its interaction as an UNO component.

Help Menu stuff

This is where we register all of the help information to display in the Help dialog.

<!--
Component Info stuff

This is where we specify the location of a file that indicates where the components are stored.
Since each component can be implemented in an arbitrary language (C++, Java, BASIC, etc.), we have 
yet another file (usually with the extension ".components") that specifies the service name and the 
implementation details of each component.

<!--
This is where we specify the location of the dynamic libraries for each of the supported systems.

To add a new system, use the same format, but change the argument after "platform=" to whatever
system you plan on adding. Then, in the "full-path=" argument, change the path to the dynamic
library for that system. Remember that you also have to bundle the compiled shared library for that 
system into the directory specified here!
