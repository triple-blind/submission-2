For Linux, first install eclipse from the eclipse download site.  Eclipse is
dependent upon Java, which is probably pre-installed, but Eclipse will hopefully
offer to install Java for you if not.  Once eclipse is running properly, check
under the (probably) Help menu and find Install New Software...  Choose
a site, possibly all available sites, look under Programming Languages,
select the C/C++ Development Tools, and proceed with the installation.  Before
you can compile properly, it is likely that a toolchain needs to be installed.
How this works is dependent on the Linux distribution, package manager, etc.
A command like "sudo yum install gcc-c++" might do the trick.

For Macintosh it migh (... something appears to have gone missing here...), first
install eclipse from the eclipse download site.
