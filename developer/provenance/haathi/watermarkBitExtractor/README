After a text document has been watermarked, converted to PDF, and then transformed into a
JPG, this program will (try to) extract the watermarks.  It could easily be modified to
work on other graphics formats.  It relies on tesseract for OCR and tesseract in turn
relies on leptonica for knowledge of graphics formats.  So, if leptonica can figure out
the format, then bits can be extracted.

This program is also automatically run by the WatermarkBitAnalyzer in the haathi4j
directory.  That program is in turn run by several others to analyze and meter the
accuracy, precision, etc. of the watermarking process.
