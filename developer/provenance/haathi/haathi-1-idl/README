Herewith begins the building of the Haathi extension.  This first step is to process
all of the IDL code that comes with the OpenOffice SDK and add to it that which is
part of Haathi and then use it to generate C++ code (class definitions in include files)
so that OpenOffice and Haathi can interface.  Not even that is completely correct,
because the OpenOffice IDL code has already been partially processed into a database
file types.rdb, which is then converted to *.hpp (and *.hdl) files.  For a diagram of
the process, see BuildProcess.odg in the README directory.  It is orchestrated by a
makefile which includes further documentation.
