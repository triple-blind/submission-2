According to its website, Tesseract is an OCR engine.  It is used with the
traitorTracer to detect tampering of a document's images.  In particular, it
is involved with watermarking in the DualWatermarkExtractor and in the
LuminanceWatermarkExtractor.  For both Windows and NonWindows, prebuilt
libraries are being used.  Those for Windows are included with this source
distribution (in libcpp/tesseract).  The Linux libraries can be installed
with commands like "sudo yum install tesseract-devel".  There is as yet no
Macintosh version unless one resorts to homebrew or similar.

Since tesseract is dependent upon leptonica, it cannot be used, under Windows
at least, in a way that statically links to the C runtime library.  Therefore
only Debug-DynLib and Release-DynLib configurations can be built.
