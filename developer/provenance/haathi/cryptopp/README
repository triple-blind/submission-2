Cryptopp provides cryptographic services.  The Windows version is compiled
from source code while non-Windows versions are built from a makefile which
configures the regular cryptopp (GNUmakefile), slightly edited.  This was
necessary because the cryptopp source directory includes assembly language files.
These aren't necessary for the library, but Eclipse tries to compile everything
in a directory and the easiest way to exclude the assembly language was to let
the makefile sort it out.  VC++ lets one specify individual files, so the
assembly could be avoided that way.  The file list was extracted from one of
the Visual Studio projects included with the source code.  Haathi uses only
a very small portion of this library.
