The Haathi extension and servers communicate using the JSON format
that is provided by this third-party source code.  It almost compiles
for all target platforms, but needs a helper include file.  Therefore,
all dependent projects should include this file instead of the one
in the libcpp/cJSON directory.

As this is source code, both debug and release versions are supported
and it can potentially (i.e., under Windows) link statically to the
C runtime library.  When that happens, and each of boost, cyassl, and
cryptopp also link statically to the runtime library, then Haathi
itself is independent of the library.  Unfortunately, the library
doesn't include the Windows networking functions and those will
eventually be linked dynamically.
