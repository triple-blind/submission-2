This project just tests whether any connection can be made via
a socket on the localhost using the TrustedServer default port.
The server could come from the MockServer or TrustedServer Java
projects or actually the cyasslServerTest C++ project and
possibly elsewhere.  No data is transferred, so the certificates
do not come into play.  The socket is opened in the way CyaSSL
does it, so it shows that CyaSSL can get at least this far.
