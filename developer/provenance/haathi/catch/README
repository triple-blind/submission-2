Catch (https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/) is being used as a unit testing
framework.  This project provides a main function for other unit testing
projects, such as watermarkTest.  Code has been added so that it plays better
with this old Visual C++ 2008.  Output is nicer and the program waits for user
acknowledgement before exiting, which helps because Visual Studio doesn't
want to capture the output in the IDE.
