In order to test the watermark recovery in a repeatible way, several
processes must be automated.  One is the conversion of a watermarked document
into an image.  In this first step of the process, a document is automatically
loaded from a plain text file, watermarked, and then exported as a PDF.  Other
programs are responsible for converting the PDF further into a graphic.  This
program also records the text of the document and the watermark bits actually
inserted so that an evaluation can be performed on watermark recovery.
