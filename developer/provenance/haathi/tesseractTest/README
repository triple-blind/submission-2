This test starts up tesseract, checks the version number, and
attempts to initialize the system.  This initialization will
fail if tesseract can't find its training data for the language,
presently English (eng).  The training data is expected in a
certain directory, a subdirectory of libcpp/tesseract.  Therefore,
the startup directory for the test has to be set to that very
tesseract directory.
