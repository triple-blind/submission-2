This program can be used to time several different Haathi operations: automatically
type a new document, load a document as if it previously existed, and save a
document.  The documents in question are expected to be text documents stored on
the local file system.  Their contents will either be typed one character at a
time and be subject to Provenance events and watermarking at that scale, or
loaded fully formed into the document and recorded as a Provenance open event
before watermarking works on the document as a whole.

The command line parameters are described in the syntax error message.  This
program links against haathi-2-lib and the two programs should be configured
with the same settings for Provenance and Watermarking being on or off.
This means, in effect, that there needs to be several versions of this program:
autotypeP1W0, autotypeP0W0, and autotypeP1W1.  This is due to some of the
settings being decided at compile time.

The extension does not been to be installed into OpenOffice in order to use this
program, since the code is linked in.  However, for syntax watermarking, the
dictionary that needs to be used is read from the installed extension's location.
So, if there is no extension, there's no dictionary and the watermarking is not
particularly effective.

There is currently a problem which prevents the automatic typing of Provenance-
enabled documents.  A query was put to the api mailing list and a bug report may
be filed if that doesn't turn up a solution.

This is a work in progress, so these comments are probably out of date.
