So that the executable can find all the right OpenOffice DLLs when it starts up
without requiring a path change, the startup directory can be set to something like

C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenOffice 4\program

Keep that in mind when specifying the file to use, because it may not be in the
updated current directory.

Try "$(ProjectDir)autotype.README" to use this very file.  Don't forget the quotes
or the command line will be misinterpreted.
