This tests whether the CyaSSL library can be linked (i.e., the build-time
conditions have been met) and whether it runs (i.e., the run-time conditions
have been met).  It doesn't actually do any networking.  It shouldn't require
any changes to firewalls.  For actual communications, see the cyasslClientTest
and cyasslServerTest projects.
