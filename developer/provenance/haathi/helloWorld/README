The source file was probably copied from an Eclipse CDT example project.
The project is intended to show that Eclipse is properly configured to process
C++ projects.  This means that Eclipse, the C/C++ Development Tooling (CDT),
and the appropriate toolchain (gcc-c++) are installed and working together,
at least if you are not developing under Windows.  For that, this will just
confirm that Visual C++ is up and running.  You wouldn't have gotten this
far if not.
