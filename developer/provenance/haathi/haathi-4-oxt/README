The fourth set to building Haathi is to collect the executable component
and also a number of resources (help files, images, license files,
configuration files, etc.) and zip them all up into an *.oxt file.
It's just a renamed zip file.  Those resource files should be accessible
from this project for potential editing.  All the copying, renaming, and
zipping is coordinated by a makefile.  A fixed directory stucture, that
suggested by the SDK is used.  There are fixed places for certain kinds
of files, so stick to that structure.
