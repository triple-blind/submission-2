The source code is zipped up for distribution with this project.
The developer should first clean up all other projects so that
as many of the intermediate files as possible are removed.  This
includes server projects in Java, since they are all zipped from
here rather than an ANT build.xml file over there.  Both
Visual Studio and Eclipse have build options for cleaning.  The
makefile of this project will delete even more files.  It is
particular to its own platform, so, for example, the Windows makefile
deletes extra files that Visual Studio produces (and Eclipse for
Java), but does not concern itself with Macintosh files.  Because
the additional files are erased unbeknownst to the IDEs, it's
important to refresh all projects and probably also recompile after
downloading a new distribution.  The Eclipse workspaces that are
included with the source aren't really intended for redistribution,
but they do contain important information about, for example,
run configurations, which should be preserved.
