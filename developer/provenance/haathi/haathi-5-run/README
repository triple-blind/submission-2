Haathi users will (likely) install the extension into a running instance of
OpenOffice by using the Extension Manager.  However, extensions can also be
installed in batch mode, assuming that OpenOffice is not already running.
This is slighly faster for developers who are living in an edit, compile,
(install), debug cycle.  This project installs Haathi and creates a batch file
that can repeat the process outside of the development environment.  Visual
Studio or nmake doesn't give makefiles a complete cin/cout environment in
which to work, so the Windows installation requires a double click on the
generated isntallation program.  Eclipse on the other platforms can install
the extension even if user input is required.
