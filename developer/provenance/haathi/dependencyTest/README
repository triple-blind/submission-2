This project is designed to ensure that all prerequisites play nicely with
each other.  One way they might not is to handle the C runtime libraries
differently, which is the case with leptonica.  Because of that, only
the Debug-DynLink and Release-DynLink configurations will run under Windows.
Luckily, only one of the test programs needs to be starting in a specific
directory: tesseract.  So, that one is configured.
