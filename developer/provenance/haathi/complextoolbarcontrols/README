The files of this project all originate from an OpenOffice SDK example
which adds a fancy toolbar to the UI.  The example used approximately
five different makefiles and a configuration program to do its work.
It also needed a Unix environment installed under Windows (and didn't
seem to work anyway).  In addition, the directory structure was not
amenable to extension.  This is a complete redesign of the build process
in one small package.  For Haathi, the process is divided into five
different stages so that intermediate results can be reused and to
shorten some stages that are likely to be repeated.  In any case,
a complete extension is built and possibly even installed in one
straightforward process.  This project, by the way, can also be used
to host parts of Haathi for debugging.  There is presently a test
of getPathToExtensionRoot() incorporated.
