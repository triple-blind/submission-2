$Header: //MyDataDepot/Projects/provenance-autoType2/servers/Configure/README#1 $

This project is used to manage the configuration of the TrustedServer,
ProvenanceServer, and the developer account for the database.  The needed
information is collected into Config objects which can be serialized and
deserialzed into an XML file which by default is called config.xml and
should be placed in the cfg directory for use with other projects.

Configure.main() creates an empty config.xml file to be filled in by
hand and copied to the correct location.  This can been done twice already
and the resulting files are called config.localhost.xml and config.escrow.xml.
One of these has likely been copied to cfg/config.xml.  Be sure to change
it depending on whether you are developing or deploying.
