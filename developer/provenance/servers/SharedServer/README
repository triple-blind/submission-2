$Header: //MyDataDepot/Projects/provenance-autoType2/servers/SharedServer/README#1 $

Code shared between the TrustedServer and ProvenanceServer is organized into
this project.  A reasonable amount of code has been factored out of the servers
and placed into base classes.  Other classes are shared entirely.  The keystore
directory is configured here so that it isn't duplicated in the server projects
and a property file is provided for AwsCredentials, even though AWS is not
currently being used.  The properties used to be hard coded.  Lastly, the
libraries that both servers used are included.
