List is a command line program that can either list the documents that
a particular user can audit or list the Provenance events of a document.
The user's email address and password must be specified in order to
access the Trusted server.  Inclusion of a document ID determines
whether the documents or the events are listed.  There is a run configuration
with example parameters specified, but the user name and password will
need to be adjusted to match the deployment setting.

The location of the Trusted server is specified in config.xml.  That
file can be generated by running main from Configure.java and such
a run configuration, called ListConfigure, was created for doing so.
In the eclipse environment the cfg directory is one level up from bin.
That may be changed for deployment for the jar.  See DeployList for that.
