Here is a simple JUnit test that confirms that the MockClient and MockServer
can exchange a message as should be indicated with the green bar.  It shows
that the firewall and SSL certificates are configured properly and that the
real servers have a good chance of working.  That chance is eventually
increased further by TrustedServerTest and ProvenanceServerTest which use
the same testing strategy.  It says nothing about the database.  In this test,
the MockServer is started and stopped by the test; it doesn't need to be
running in advance.
