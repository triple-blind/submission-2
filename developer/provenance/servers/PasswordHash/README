$Header: //MyDataDepot/Projects/provenance-autoType2/servers/PasswordHash/README#1 $

The passwords stored in the TrustedServer should be salted and hashed
so that they aren't sitting there in cleartext for anyone to read.
This library takes care of that.  Unfortunately, the original source
did not include a package specification so that the code cannot be imported
into other packages.  The line

package secure.provenance; // Unfortunately, some package should be added here

should be added to the top to get it to play nicely with the rest of the system.
