This project can produce documentation for all of the other projects and
deposit it all in the doc directory.  Find index.html and open it in a web
browser.  Neither BouncyCastle nor JUnit are included, the former because
of size and online availability and the latter because it involves an
absolute path that isn't easily shared between computers.  Some of the
documentation should also appear in the Eclipse Javadoc window.  In order for
build.xml to run successfully (right click, choose Run As or Debug As and
then Ant Build), javadoc must be available to the operating system (e.g.,
in the PATH).  javadoc is normally part of the JDK which is not required
for Eclipse.  If you are only using the JRE, this project may not run.
