BouncyCastle provides cryptographic services for the server side when the
standard Java libraries can't handle them.  This occurs in one specific
place: secure.provenance.X509CertificateGenerator.java in the TrustedServer
project.  Of the multiple BouncyCastle components, only the bcprov and
bcpkix are needed.  Two BouncyCastle files from bcprov had to be modified in
order to provide the needed functionality.  For the most part this involved
making private methods or variables public.  Had they only been protected,
functionality could have been overridden with a subclass.  In any case, this
project provides access to the required packages, modified or not.
