The Pinger is similar to the TrustedServerTest and ProvenanceServerTest,
but the tests start up servers and shut them down in their check for
connectivity.  This doesn't especially help test a running server.  The
Pinger checks whether an already running server is listening and leaves
it running.  It checks for both servers.  Because it's not uncommon for
one or the other not to be started up, especially during testing in which
mock servers may be using the same address and port, Pinger is not
implemented as a test.  Start a server, or believe one to have been
started, and run Pinger to check for a confirmation message.
