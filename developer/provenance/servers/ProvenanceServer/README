The infamous Provenance server lives here and this description will sound
very much like that of its companion server, TrustedServer.  For background
on what it does, please read "Provenance Server.doc" in the README project.
It receives commands from the Haathi extension (or ProvenanceServerTest) and
processes them. It _should_ also be (remotely) connected to the Trusted server,
but that connection is presently implemented by simply sharing the database.
That database is currently provided by SQLite and is set in getDataAccessor() of
ProvenanceCommandProcessor.  You'll see the other option there of a
ProvenanceEC2DynamoDataAccessor there.  Since the AWS version was last working,
Amazon updated its interface.  All of the ProvenanceServer code was updated to
compile against the new interface, but it has never actually run or been
tested.  It is recommended that a ProvenanceEC2DynamoDataAccessorTest project
be used to test the interface if it ever needs to be used again.
