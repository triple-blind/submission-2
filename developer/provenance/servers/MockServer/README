$Header: //MyDataDepot/Projects/provenance-autoType2/servers/MockServer/README#1 $

In this project a server is implemented that imitates (mocks) the Trusted
and Provenance servers in how they access the network.  The full servers
are/were too monolithic to be used for network diagnostics such as testing
the firewall and SSL certificates.  This much simpler server was developed
for testing purposes.  The server can be configured by private static
variables to default to settings appropriate for either the Trusted or
Provenance servers.  It does not understand any commands, but assumes that
it has been PINGed and returns an affirmative response.  Since a PING does
not require authentication or authorization beyond SSL, this is not a test
of the database in any way.
