The test in question is a simple PING to the ProvenanceServer, and this
description parallels that of the correspsonding TrustedServerTest.  The PING
which could just as well come from Haathi.  However, the Haathi extension that
normally provides commands to ProvenanceServer is not easily automated.  This
project sends commands to the ProvenanceServer and and checks that they are
accepted, as evidenced by the green bar.  Currently only a PING command is
used to make sure the server is awake and responding, but more thorough tests
could easily be added.  The next project, ProvenanceLocalSQLiteDataAccessorTest
takes addresses that responsibility.  As mentioned previously, a MockClient is
used to send the commands.  The ProvenanceServer is started and stopped by the
test, so it doesn't need to be started ahead of time.  The PING request does
not require any use information, so this is not a test of the database.  It is
conveyed across the network, so the real ProvenanceServer with its configured
address, ports, certificates and all are actually used.
