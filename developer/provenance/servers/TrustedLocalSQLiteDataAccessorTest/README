While the TrustedServerTest sends commands through the entire network,
this test uses the back door and sends commands to the component that
accesses the database, in this case the TrustedLocalSQLiteDataAccessor.
This skips the network infrastructure and also the decoding of the JSON
command arguments.  It also doesn't need to worry about threading.  It
can simulate addition of users, creation of documents, and the like.
Such tests should be prepared for each new data storage mechanism, which
could be fairly easily configured.  This is the closest that the servers
have to a scripting mechanisms and will be good for simulation.  No
server needs to be running for the test.
