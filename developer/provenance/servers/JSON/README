The Haathi extension and servers communicate using the JSON format that is
provided by this third-party source code.  There is a corresponding cJSON
project for C++ and also a cJSONTest project (just because of the
complications of creating shared, cross-platform C++ libraries) with examples.
The files here are copied verbatim from the JSON website that is linked from
the Provenance downloads page.  The source is compiled into jar file that is
reused by other projects.
