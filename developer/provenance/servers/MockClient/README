In order to test the (mock) server, a (mock) client is needed.  That client
might come from the C++ side, but that functionality is not yet assumed.
Here's a client that can send some simple, hard-coded, requests to
MockServer for testing.  MockServer assumes that PING requests are received
and what the client sends is actually a well-formulated request.  As a result,
MockClient can communicate with the actual TrustedServer or ProvenanceServer
and is it used in test cases for that purpose.  The client can be configured
by private static variables to default to settings appropriate for either the
Trusted or Provenance servers.
