The test in question is a simple PING, which could just as well come from
Haathi.  However, the Haathi extension that normally provides commands to
TrustedServer is not easily automated.  This project sends commands to the
TrustedServer and and checks that they are accepted, as evidenced by the green
bar.  Currently only a PING command is used to make sure the server is awake
and responding, but more thorough tests could easily be added.  The next
project, TrustedLocalSQLiteDataAccessorTest takes addresses that responsibility.
As mentioned previously, a MockClient is used to send the commands.  The
TrustedServer is started and stopped by the test, so it doesn't need to be
started ahead of time.  The PING request does not require any use information,
so this is not a test of the database.  It is conveyed across the network,
so the real TrustedServer with its configured address, ports, certificates and
all are actually used.
