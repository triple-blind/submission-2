While the ProvenanceServerTest sends commands through the entire network,
this test, like the corresponding TrustedLocalSQLiteDataAccessorTest, uses
the back door and sends commands to the component that accesses the
database, in this case the ProvenanceLocalSQLiteDataAccessor.  This skips
the network infrastructure and also the decoding of the JSON command
arguments.  It also doesn't need to worry about threading.  It
can simulate loading, storing, and auditing documents.  Such tests should
be prepared for each new data storage mechanism, which could be fairly
easily configured.  This is the closest that the servers have to a scripting
mechanisms and will be good for simulation.  No server needs to be running for
the test.
