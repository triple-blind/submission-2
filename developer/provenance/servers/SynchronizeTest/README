This is a simple test just to verify that synchronization
works as expected, since the (Java) documentation was a little ambiguous.
The SQLite4Java documentation is even more sparse.  If a series of SQL
statements uses multiple tables, what if any synchronization needs to be
done?  I can imagine that each prepare or step call locks the appropriate
tables or rows for read or write, but if there are multiple prepares,
they can't know about each other (yet).  Perhaps a transaction will take
care of it.
