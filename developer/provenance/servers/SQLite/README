Account details like names and passwords, but also cryptographic keys, and
the significant amounts of data the Haathi extension produces are stored in
one or multiple databases.  One possibility especially particularly well suited
for testing is a simple sqlite database.  This project includes the libraries
and the JNI files that provide access to the database.  Libraries are included
for all three target platforms and the ComboServer is deployed with all files.
At one point in the project's history, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 device
was used, but it isn't currently.  The configured database is set in
getDataAccessor() of the TrustedCommandProcessor or ProvenanceCommandProcessor.
So, you don't need to have an AWS account in order to work on this.
