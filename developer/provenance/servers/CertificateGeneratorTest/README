The TrustedServer generates certificates, in particular X509 certificates
in the X509CertificateGenerator class.  This green bar verifies that a
private/public key pair and the certificate in general can be created.
Internally to TrustedServer this functionality is provided by BouncyCastle.
The format of the keystore has been changed so that it matches the format
of the SSL certificates.  This test assures that and functionality is
preserved.
