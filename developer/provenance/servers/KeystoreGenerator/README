This project can be used to generate a complete set of certificates for the
two Trusted and Provenance servers and Haathi.  Be careful, since this
source code and its default passwords are public, anyone can extract the
private keys that it produces.  The project should be rerun before the system
goes into production.  It is run from build.xml.  Right click on build.xml
and run or debug as an Ant Build.  Files are written to a keystore directory
within the project.  In order to use the values with deployed server or even
any of the test programs, they need to be copied to the outer keystore
directory, servers/keystore.  Be sure to archive the values that used to be
there, especially if they are supporting any deployed clients or servers.
The way the certificates are generated is probably only one of multiple ways
that the system can be put together.  It is unclear from the documentation
whether new users, especially ones needing eventual client validation, are
required to have their own certificates.  This project would need to be changed
to support multiple Haathi certificates.
