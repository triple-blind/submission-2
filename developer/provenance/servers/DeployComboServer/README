This project is used to create first a .jar and then a .zip file containing
all the materials needed to deploy the ComboServer with its required libraries,
JNI files, database, keystore, a startup file just in case, and some double
click support.  The user (may) need only unzip the file and double click on
the jar in order to run the servers.  Here are some recently used basic
installation instructions for the ComboServer that can be reused:


Download and unzip ComboServer.zip.  You should find extracted

db - a folder that contains the SQLite database

ComboServer.jar - a Java archive containing both the Provenance and Trusted
servers complete with SSL certificates that work with the current Haathi
extension. 

ComboServer.sh - a shell script that shows how the server could be started
from the command line or other script.  If double clicking on ComboServer.jar
does not start the servers, then it may be necessary to start them from
the command line.  One would need to "chmod u+x ComboServer.jar" in order to
run it or simply copy the commands to the command line.

Multiple .so, .jnilib, and .dll files - the JNI (Java native interface) files
for Linux, Macintosh, and Windows, respectively, that provide an interface to
SQLite from the Java libraries that the servers use. 

So, cross your fingers and click on ComboServer.jar first.
