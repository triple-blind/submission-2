The database user table is supplied with a single user in DatabaseGenerator,
but that isn't really enough to do anything useful with Haathi.  This project
adds another three users, a simple user, an auditor, and an administrator so
that some simple exploration can be performed.  Some component will eventually
need to manage how users are added to the system.  Presently they can be added
by direct database manipulation, this UserCreate project, or the C++ userCreate
project.  The first can easily be misused and the latter two have no user
interface.  The DatabaseGenerator includes the functionality, but it would need
slight modification.  This version works over the network and assumes that
TrustedServer is running.  Comments in the code can be edited to start the
server.  However, this shows how additional users might be created and it is
waiting for a UI.
