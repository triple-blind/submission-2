Documentation, namely "Provenance Server.doc", seems to strongly imply
that the two servers are independent entities that coordinate their work
over the network.  That functionality does not appear to have been
implemented.  Haathi, however, is oblivious and the system will work,
especially for testing purposes, if the same computer runs both servers
and they coordinate their work by sharing the same backend database. 
This project combines the Trusted and Provenance servers into
a single program that starts them both up for convenience.  Killing the
single parent process will also stop both the servers.  This makes for a
simple test deployment on other machines.
