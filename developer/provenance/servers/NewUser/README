This is a tiny project including a class which will create a new user.
Unlike UserCreate, it does not include any server and this can be
deployed with DeployNewUser so that it can be run outside of the
development system.  The TrustedServer should be running on the local
machine.  Beware that the developer's credentials are contained
in the source code.  In addition, the new user's password is entered
on the command line.  Various shells which track history may capture it.
