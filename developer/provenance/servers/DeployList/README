Running the Ant build should result in List.jar which can be used to
list Provenance documents or events outside of any development
environment and independently of Haathi or OpenOffice.  See the
List project for details about the program.  Deployment is to a .jar
file which should result in a stand-alone (except for java)
executable.  If necessary, the config.xml file could be edited after
deployment to address a different server.  Since this is not expected
to be the case, the file remains tucked away within the .jar.  Run
build.xml as an Ant Build to make this work rather than using a Java
run configuration.
