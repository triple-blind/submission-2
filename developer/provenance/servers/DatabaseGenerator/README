$Header: //MyDataDepot/Projects/provenance-autoType2/servers/DatabaseGenerator/README#1 $

This project creates the local SQLite database tables that the two servers
can access and populates them with an initial user so that other projects,
UserCreate for Java or userCreate for C++, can be used to create additional
users.  Three different databases are actually created: provenance.db,
shared.db, and trusted.db in the ../db directory.  If the Trusted and
Provenance servers run on different machines, then they (probably) need to
have separate databases and also an as yet unimplemented method of coordinating
their databases.  If they run on the same machine, they can easily access a
shared database and "communicate" via shared values in the database.  I don't
think that's the intended design, but it was how even the Amazon AWS version
was implemented.  As for these local databases, you'll want to edit at least
the password in this DatabaseGenerator.java file (or edit the resulting
database) if you don't want to use the default password that everyone else
knows.  See also the discussion of the db directory in the main README file,
because it needs to be prepared for deployment.
